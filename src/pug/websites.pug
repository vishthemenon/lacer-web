              | Over 30 million people suffer from multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy or Parkinson's disease worldwide. These diseases, along with many other conditions, often result in reduced fine motor control. Whilst solutions exist to help with many of the big problems that such conditions can bring, there are few products out there to assist with minor every-day tasks, like tying your shoelaces. For many younger patients, it can be frustrating to have to wear special footwear and feel different from their peers.

              | Many groups of people experience difficulties bending down, whether it's because of preganency or back injuries or many other causes. 80% of people in UK and US experience back pain at some stage in their lives. This is a large proportion of population who are also unable to tie laces.
